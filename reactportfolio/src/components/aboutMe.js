            <p>  I am a Jr Developer from Charlotte, North Carolina. I enjoy working on problems and chipping away at projects until something beautiful has been created. I was born in Greenville, South Carolina where I lived untill college. Sometime after obtaining my Bachelor's degree in psychology and classical studiys, and a few years at law school I moved to Charlotte, NC. There I found myself working with kids on the spectrum. </p>
            <br/>
            <p> Lifes crazy but along the way I've realized how much I love to work with a project and watch it grow. Being a developer is a perfect oppertunity to work on projects, both for myself and a growing industry, and watch them both evolve. Lifes crazy! Where will it take me next? Hopefully your next project!  </p>
